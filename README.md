# Q_learning
Implementation of Q_learning in a 2D Markovian Domain

In this repository, there are 5 files centered around an artificial mining problem. 
"even_smaller-Recovered.png" is a 10x10 map that the agent operates in.
"library.py" includes the class, variables, functions etc. for the agent
"main_algorithm.py" includes the main learning loop of the Q_learning algorithm
"visualization.py" includes the code used to visualize the results 
"Dict1500.pk" is a file that contains the trained Q-table after 1500 iterations. It can be accessed through Pickle.
